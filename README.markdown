## Overview

This module installs, configures and manages spamassassin either as a service (through spamd) or for use with applications like amavisd.

## Module Description

Spamassassin has a huge array of configuration directives, this module tries to give the user access to as many of them as possible. There are a lot of class
parameters and most of them have a brief description of it's function in the header of the class file. For more information see: http://spamassassin.apache.org/full/3.3.x/doc/Mail_SpamAssassin_Conf.html

## Setup

### What spamassassin affects

* spamassassin package.
* spamassassin configuration files: local.cf, v310.cf, v312.cf, v320.cf and sql.cf (optional).
* spamassassin service (optional).
* optional packages: razor, pyzor and dkim.

### Setup Requirements

On Redhat systems, if you enable razor and/or pyzor, the packages need to come from  EPEL, which is not managed by this module. See https://forge.puppetlabs.com/stahnma/epel.

The installation of the DCC plugin, if enabled, needs to be handled elsewhere.
	
### Beginning with spamassassin	

Minimal usage for spamd

```
class { 'spamassassin':
  sa_update       => true,

## Reference

### Classes

#### Public Classes

* spamassassin: Main class, includes all other classes.

#### Private Classes

* spamassassin::params: Default values.

### Parameters

The following parameters are available in the spamassassin module:

#### `sa_update`
Boolean. Enable the sa-update cron job.
Default: false

#### `run_execs_as_user`
If you enabled razor and/or pyzor and would
like the razor-admin or pyzor discover commands
to be run as a different user specify the username
in this directive. Example: amavis. Default: undef

#### `package_name`
String. The package name to use.
Default: Distribution specific

#### `service_enable`
Boolean. Will enable service at boot
and ensure a running service.

#### `service_name`
String. The service name to use for the spamassassin service.
Default: Distribution specific

#### `spamd_max_children`
This option specifies the maximum number of children to spawn.
Spamd will spawn that number of children, then sleep in the background
until a child dies, wherein it will go and spawn a new child.

#### `spamd_syslog_facility`
This option defines the log location where SpamAssassin will deposit logs,
this can either be a file location or a syslog name

```puppet
Examples:
spamd_syslog_facility => 'mail' # use syslog, facility mail
spamd_syslog_facility => './mail' # log to file ./mail
spamd_syslog_facility => 'stderr 2>/dev/null' # log to stderr, throw messages away
spamd_syslog_facility => 'null' # the same as above
spamd_syslog_facility => 'file' # log to file ./spamd.log
spamd_syslog_facility => '/var/log/spamd.log' # log to file /var/log/spamd.log
```

See the details of the -s option in spamd documentation for more information.

#### `spamd_min_children`
The minimum number of children that will be kept running
The minimum value is 1, the default value is 1 in spamd, and undef here.
If you have lots of free RAM, you may want to increase this.

#### `spamd_listen_address`
Tells spamd to listen on the specified IP address (defaults to 127.0.0.1).
Use 0.0.0.0to listen on all interfaces. You can also use a  valid hostname
which will make spamd listen on the first address that name resolves to.

#### `spamd_allowed_ips`
Specify a list of authorized hosts or networks which can connect to this
spamd instance. Single IP addresses, CIDR format networks, or ranges of
IP addresses by listing 3 or less octets with a trailing dot. Hostnames
are not supported, only IP addresses.  This option can be specified
multiple times, or can take a list of addresses separated by commas.

#### `spamd_username`
spamd runs as this user

#### `spamd_groupname`
spamd runs in this group

#### `spamd_nouserconfig`
Turn off (on) reading of per-user configuration files (user_prefs) from
the user's home directory. The default behaviour is to read per-user
configuration from the user's home directory (--user-config).

#### `spamd_allowtell`
Allow learning and forgetting (to a local Bayes database), reporting and
revoking (to a remote database) by spamd. The client issues a TELL command
to tell what type of message is being processed and whether local (learn/forget)
or remote (report/revoke) databases should be updated.

#### `spamd_sql_config`
Turn on SQL lookups even when per-user config files have been disabled with -x
this is useful for spamd hosts which don’t have user’s home directories
but do want to load user preferences from an SQL database.

#### `required_score`
Set the score required before a mail is considered spam. n.nn can be an
integer or a real number.

#### `score_tests`
Assign scores (the number of points for a hit) to a given test.
Scores can be positive or negative real numbers or integers.

#### `custom_rules`
Define custom rules. This is a hash of hashes. The key for the outer hash is the
spamassassin rule name, the inner hash for each entry should contain the rule definition, e.g:

```puppet
spamassassin::custom_rules:
  INVOICE_SPAM:
    body: '/Invoice.*from.*You have received an invoice from .* To start with it, print out or download a JS copy of your invoice/'
    score: 6
    describe: 'spam reported claiming "You have received an invoice"'
```

#### `custom_config`
Add custom lines to the config file. Useful for configuring modules that aren't otherwise
handled by this Puppet module. This is an array of strings, e.g:

```puppet
spamassassin::custom_config:
  - hashcash_accept *@example.com
  - hashcash_accept *@example.net
```

#### `whitelist_from`
Used to whitelist sender addresses which send mail that is often
tagged (incorrectly) as spam. This would be written to the global
local.cf file

#### `whitelist_from_rcvd`
Used to whitelist the combination of a sender address and rDNS name/IP.
This would be written to the global local.cf file

#### `whitelist_to`
If the given address appears as a recipient in the message headers
(Resent-To, To, Cc, obvious envelope recipient, etc.) the mail will
be whitelisted.

#### `blacklist_from`
Used to specify addresses which send mail that is often
tagged (incorrectly) as non-spam, but which the user doesn't want.

#### `blacklist_to`
If the given address appears as a recipient in the message headers
(Resent-To, To, Cc, obvious envelope recipient, etc.) the mail will
be blacklisted.

#### `rewrite_header_subject`
By default, suspected spam messages will not have the Subject, From
or To lines tagged to indicate spam. By setting this option, the header
will be tagged with the value of the parameter to indicate that a message
is spam.

#### `rewrite_header_from`
See rewrite_header_subject.

#### `rewrite_header_to`
See rewrite_header_subject.

#### `report_safe`

by spammers, open relays, or open proxies.

#### `clear_internal_networks`
Boolean. Empty the list of internal networks. Default: false

#### `internal_networks`
Internal means that relay hosts on these networks are considered
to be MXes for your domain(s), or internal relays.

#### `skip_rbl_checks`
Boolean. If false SpamAssassin will run RBL checks. Default: true

#### `dns_available`
If set to 'test', SpamAssassin will query some default hosts on the

but increases database size by about a factor of 8 to 10. Default: true

#### `bayes_auto_learn`
Boolean. Whether SpamAssassin should automatically feed high-scoring mails
into its learning systems. Default: true

#### `bayes_ignore_header`
See http://spamassassin.apache.org/full/3.3.x/doc/Mail_SpamAssassin_Conf.html#bayes_ignore_header

#### `bayes_auto_expire`
Boolean. If enabled, the Bayes system will try to automatically expire old
tokens from the database. Default: true

Bayes storage. By default will use the mysql driver and a database called
spamassassin. Please note the module does not manage any database settings
or the creation of the schema.

#### `bayes_sql_username`
The sql username used for the dsn provided above.

#### `bayes_sql_password`
The sql password used for the dsn provided above.

#### `bayes_sql_override_username`
If this options is set the BayesStore::SQL module will override the set
username with the value given. This could be useful for implementing global

#### `dcc_body_max`
This option sets how often a message's body/fuz1/fuz2 checksum
must have been reported to the DCC server before SpamAssassin
will consider the DCC check as matched. As nearly all DCC clients
are auto-reporting these checksums, you should set this to a relatively
high value, e.g. 999999 (this is DCC's MANY count). Default: 999999

#### `dcc_fuz1_max`

Default: 5

#### `pyzor_options`
Specify additional options to the pyzor command. Please note that only characters
in the range [0-9A-Za-z ,._/-] are allowed for security reasons. Please note that
the module will automatically add the homedir options as part of the configuration.

#### `pyzor_path`
This option tells SpamAssassin specifically where to find the pyzor client instead
of relying on SpamAssassin to find it in the current PATH.

Boolean. Enable/disable the Pyzor plugin. Default: false

#### `spamcop_from_address`
This address is used during manual reports to SpamCop as the From: address. You
can use your normal email address. If this is not set, a guess will be used as
the From: address in SpamCop reports.

#### `spamcop_to_address`
Your customized SpamCop report submission address. You need to obtain this address
by registering at http://www.spamcop.net/. If this is not set, SpamCop reports will
go to a generic reporting address for SpamAssassin users and your reports will probably

## Limitations

This module is tested against Puppet 6.0 and higher.

The module has been tested on:

* CentOS 7 and 8
  * CentOS 8 is EOL. This module still keeps compatibility to this release
    until version 7 is also EOL since supporting version 8 should come at no
    additional maintenance cost.
* Debian 10 and 11
* Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04

## Development

1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/forking/) puppet-spamassassin
