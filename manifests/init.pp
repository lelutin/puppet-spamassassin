# == Class: spamassassin
#
# This module installs and configures spamassassin
# and a few of it's plugins.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*sa_update*]
# Boolean. Enable the sa-update cron job.
# Default: false
#
# [*run_execs_as_user*]
# If you enabled razor and/or pyzor and would
# like the razor-admin or pyzor discover commands
# to be run as a different user specify the username
# in this directive. Example: amavis. Default: undef
#
# [*package_name*]
# String. The package name to use.
# Default: Distribution specific
#
# [*service_enabled*]
# Boolean. Will enable service at boot
# and ensure a running service.
#
# [*service_name*]
# String. The service name to use for the spamassassin service.
# Default: Distribution specific
#
# [*notify_service_name*]
# String. If specified then this service will be notified instead of "spamd"
# when config is update. Only has an effect if service_enabled is false.
#
# [*spamd_max_children*]
# This option specifies the maximum number of children to spawn.
# Spamd will spawn that number of children, then sleep in the background
# until a child dies, wherein it will go and spawn a new child.
#
# [*spamd_min_children*]
# The minimum number of children that will be kept running
# The minimum value is 1, the default value is 1 in spamd, and undef here.
# If you have lots of free RAM, you may want to increase this.
#
# [*spamd_listen_address*]
# List of IP addresses spamd will listen to (defaults to "localhost",
# which will listen both on IPv4 and IPv6 locally). Use 0.0.0.0 to listen on
# all interfaces. You can also use a valid hostname which will make spamd
# listen on the first address that name resolves to. To listen only to an IPv6
# address, make sure to encase the address within square brackets (i.e.
# "[fe80::fc54:ff:fe8f:4b36]")
#
# [*spamd_allowed_ips*]
# Specify a list of authorized hosts or networks which can connect to this
# spamd instance. Values can be single IP addresses or CIDR format networks.
# Hostnames are not supported, only IP addresses. Similarly to
# spamd_listen_address, to specify IPs or CIDR notation for IPV6, make sure to
# encase the address or network part in square brackets)
#
# [*spamd_username*]
# spamd runs as this user
#
# [*spamd_groupname*]
# spamd runs in this group
#
# [*spamd_nouserconfig*]
# Turn off (on) reading of per-user configuration files (user_prefs) from
# the user's home directory. The default behaviour is to read per-user
# configuration from the user's home directory (--user-config).
#
# [*spamd_allowtell*]
# Allow learning and forgetting (to a local Bayes database), reporting and
# revoking (to a remote database) by spamd. The client issues a TELL command
# to tell what type of message is being processed and whether local (learn/forget)
# or remote (report/revoke) databases should be updated.
#
# [*spamd_sql_config*]
# Turn on SQL lookups even when per-user config files have been disabled with -x
# this is useful for spamd hosts which dont have users home directories
# but do want to load user preferences from an SQL database.
#
# [*spamd_syslog_facility*]
# Turn this on to deposit logs for SpamAssassin and define the log location.
# e.g. /var/log/spamd.log
#
# [*configdir*]
# Absolute path to the directory containing spamassassin's configuration files.
#
# [*spamd_options_file*]
# Absolute path to the file containing global options to spamd.
#
# [*spamd_options_var*]
# Name of the shell variable used for storing spamd options in
# spamd_options_file.
#
# [*spamd_defaults*]
# String of spamd option flags set in spamd_options_file.
#
# [*sa_update_file*]
# Absolute path to file that contains shell variables for sa-update.
#
# [*required_score*]
# Set the score required before a mail is considered spam. n.nn can be an
# integer or a real number.
#
# [*score_tests*]
# Assign scores (the number of points for a hit) to a given test.
# Scores can be positive or negative real numbers or integers.
#
# [*custom_rules*]
# Define custom rules. This is a hash of hashes. The key for the outer hash is the
# spamassassin rule name, the inner hash for each entry should contain the rule definition, e.g:
#
# spamassassin::custom_rules:
#   INVOICE_SPAM:
#     body: '/Invoice.*from.*You have received an invoice from .* To start with it, print out or download a JS copy of your invoice/'
#     score: 6
#     describe: 'spam reported claiming "You have received an invoice"'
#
# [*custom_config*]
# Add custom lines to the config file. Useful for configuring modules that aren't otherwise
# handled by this Puppet module. This is an array of strings, e.g:
#
# spamassassin::custom_config:
#   - hashcash_accept *@example.com
#   - hashcash_accept *@example.net

# tagged (incorrectly) as spam. This would be written to the global
# local.cf file

# tagged (incorrectly) as non-spam, but which the user doesn't want.
#
# [*blacklist_to*]
# If the given address appears as a recipient in the message headers
# (Resent-To, To, Cc, obvious envelope recipient, etc.) the mail will
# be blacklisted.
#
# [*rewrite_header_subject*]
# By default, suspected spam messages will not have the Subject, From
# or To lines tagged to indicate spam. By setting this option, the header
# will be tagged with the value of the parameter to indicate that a message
# is spam.

# Boolean. If true will write the SQL-related directives to local.cf.
# Default: false
#
# [*bayes_sql_dsn*]

#
# [*bayes_store_module*]
# This parameter configures the module that spamassassin will use when
# connecting to the Bayes SQL database. The default will work for most
# database types, but selecting the module for a DBMS may result provide
# performance improvements or additional features. Certain modules may
# require the additional perl modules that are not installed by this Puppet
# module.
#
# [*bayes_path*]
# This is the directory and filename for Bayes databases. Please note this
# parameter is not used if bayes_sql_enabled is true.
#

# must have been reported to the DCC server before SpamAssassin
# will consider the DCC check as matched. As nearly all DCC clients
# are auto-reporting these checksums, you should set this to a relatively
# high value, e.g. 999999 (this is DCC's MANY count). Default: 999999
#
# [*dcc_fuz1_max*]
# See dcc_body_max. Default: 999999

#
# [*razor_timeout*]
# How many seconds you wait for Razor to complete before you go on without the results.
# Default: 5
#
# [*razor_home*]
# Define the homedir for razor. Please note that if you set a custom path the module will
# automatically use the directory in which you store your razor config as the home
# directory for the module. Default is to use the [global config dir]/.razor
#
# [*spamcop_enabled*]
# Boolean. Enable/disable the Pyzor plugin. Default: false
#

# sql dsn, and other directives, to local.cf. Default: false
#
# [*awl_dsn*]
# This parameter gives the connect string used to connect to the SQL based
# storage. By default will use the mysql driver and a database called
